    "\n",
    "<b>Answer:</b> I am most familiar with Python, so I would probably start with that. There are multiple ways to do it within Python. You can load the rows into python as lists (row_list = line.split(',') or equivalent) and then arrange as necessary and use the json package to write the output file. You can also write the json \"manually\" in Python by placing the brackets, braces and commas as necessary.\n",

Therefore the function is evaluated at the last value that i took within the list comprehension inside the function (i=3). One way to fix it is to define a helper function. In this case the lambda function is evaluated and stored at each value of i.\n",
